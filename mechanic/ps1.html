    <h2> Qestion 1: Projectile range</h2>
    <p> A gun fires shells with a muzzle velocity u at an angle \theta to the horizontal. Show that the shells fly furthest when theta = pi * 4. What is the maximum range when u = 200ms^-1? Assume that g =  10ms^-2 and ignore all forces other than gravity. </p>

    <h2> Qestion 2: White City roller coaster</h2>
    <p>A carriage is lifted from the ground at A to the top of the hill at B using a chain system, then released from B at a very low initial speed. It accelerates down to the ground at C, rises to D, and descends to E, which is at the same height as A. The carriage then returns to the starting point A along a flat track (not shown on diagram), where it is stopped for the passengers to alight. The tracks near points C and D are arcs of circles of radius 10â€†m. Assume for simplicity that g = 10 ms^-2.</p>
